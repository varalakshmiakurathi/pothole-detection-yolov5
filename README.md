# Pothole Detection using YOLOv5
This repository contains code for detecting potholes in images and videos using the YOLOv5 object detection model. The aim is to detect and locate potholes accurately, contributing to infrastructure maintenance and road safety efforts.  

Yolov5 model is used to train the custom object detection model for pothole detections on roads.
